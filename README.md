# ForkMyRecipe

**ForkMyRecipe** is a web application that allows users to copy ("fork") existing recipes, make their own custom modifications, and save them to their profiles. Inspired by GitHub's fork and version control system, this app offers a collaborative space for cooking enthusiasts to share, modify, and personalize recipes.

## Features

- **Recipe Forking**: Users can copy recipes to their profiles and make adjustments to ingredients, instructions, or portions.
- **Version Control**: Track the history of recipe modifications, allowing users to view and revert to previous versions.
- **Collaborative Recipe Creation**: Propose changes to community recipes, share tips, and suggest improvements.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile where they can view, edit, and manage their customized recipes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (using Mongoose for schema-based models)
- **Authentication**: Firebase or Passport.js
- **Version Control for Recipes**: MongoDB stores different versions of each recipe, linking back to original versions.
